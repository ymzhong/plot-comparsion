# CompasionTool

A mathematica notebook to overlap one graph onto another graph.

After importing the figures, please right click the graphs and choose "Get Coordinate", copy the coordinate in the order of x_axis_min, x_axis_max, y_axis_min, y_axis_max, and paste in "Fig X Coordinate Setting" section. The face value of the axis ticks should also be set in the same section.

After setting the coordinate for the two figures, run "Processing" section to get the pannel for the overlapping plot. The opacity of the overlapped plot can be adjusted. The orders of the two figures can be switched.
